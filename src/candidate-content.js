There is currently no plan for the remaining $40 billion needed, however, and this lack of funding poses a major threat to NYCHA. Without adequate resources, NYCHA residents will face a continuation and exacerbation of the problems of past years, pushing the system back into crisis. My goal as Mayor would be to prioritize resident-led processes to address NYCHA’s ongoing capital needs, while finding new solutions. Resident support for RAD/PACT and the Trust varies, and it is important that residents are fully engaged in planning around these capital needs every step of the way. I also vow to fight for Albany to overturn its decades of investment and at a bare minimum start to match City funding.
