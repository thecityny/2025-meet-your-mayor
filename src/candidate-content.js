Through this new city agency and whole-of-government approach, community safety will be prioritized like never before in NYC. The Department will invest in citywide mental health programs and crisis response—including deploying dedicated outreach workers in 100 subway stations, providing medical services in vacant commercial units, and increasing Transit Ambassadors to assist New Yorkers on their journeys—expand evidence-based gun violence prevention programs, and increase funding to hate violence prevention programs by 800%.

I will create a comprehensive, citywide planning process to allow NYC to both address the legacy of racially discriminatory zoning and proactively plan for the health and needs of the city—in housing, transit, education, and other areas.

There is currently no plan for the remaining $40 billion needed, however, and this lack of funding poses a major threat to NYCHA. Without adequate resources, NYCHA residents will face a continuation and exacerbation of the problems of past years, pushing the system back into crisis. My goal as Mayor would be to prioritize resident-led processes to address NYCHA’s ongoing capital needs, while finding new solutions. Resident support for RAD/PACT and the Trust varies, and it is important that residents are fully engaged in planning around these capital needs every step of the way. I also vow to fight for Albany to overturn its decades of investment and at a bare minimum start to match City funding.
